## Create a new project

Create a new project and install the Formance SDK for Python:

```bash
mkdir formance-python-example
cd formance-python-example
```

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the Formance SDK for Python, as well as the Formance OAuth helper:

```bash
pip install formance-sdk formance-sdk-oauth
```

:::info

The Formance API relies on OAuth 2.0 for authentication.

The Formance OAuth helper simplifies the OAuth flow and provides a simple interface to obtain an access token using the `client_credentials` grant type.

For more information, see [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/).

:::

:::danger

The Formance OAuth helper uses the `client_credentials` grant type, which requires a client ID and client secret. These are sensitive credentials that should not be exposed to the public.

If you're integrating Formance into a web application, you should use an OAuth flow that does not require a client secret, such as the [authorization code grant](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/).

{/* TODO : Add a documentation page explaining how to use the OAuth authorization code grant */}

## Hello World from the Formance Ledger

Create a file called `main.py` and add the following code:

```python title="main.py"
from sdk import SDK as Formance
from formance_sdk_oauth import create_authorization_provider

# highlight-next-line
ENDPOINT = "https://xxxxxxxxxx-xxxx.sandbox.formance.cloud"

formance = Formance(
    server_url=ENDPOINT,
    authorization=create_authorization_provider(
        endpoint_url=ENDPOINT,
        # highlight-start
        # These are sensitive credentials that should not be exposed to the public.
        client_id="6a936dfe-xxxx-yyyy-zzzz-9019a1e9b9e3",
        client_secret="20bd58c4-xxxx-yyyy-zzzz-dc05258bc959"
        # highlight-end
    )
)

def main():
    response = formance.ledger.get_info()
    print(response.config_info_response.data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

:::info
You'll need the API endpoint and the credentials created during the [SDK's Getting Started](/getting-started/sdk) guide. If you don't have them, you can create them by following the guide.
:::

Next, run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

You should see a similar output.

```bash
{
  config: { storage: { driver: 'postgres', ledgers: [Array] } },
  server: 'numary-ledger',
  version: 'v1.10.13'
}
```

:::tip
Numary is the Formance's former name.
